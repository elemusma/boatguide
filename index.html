              The aim of this guide is to teach a complex and technical sport in an easily to understand manner for everyone to understand. Recently, sailing has evolved in incredible ways. There are a lot of different varieties of sailing - from inshore and offshore
              sailing, racing and world-wide voyages. The author, Bob Bond, has created training programs that are now used worldwide, which helped him expand his knowledge in handling modern boats and teaching the art of sailing. The techniques are shown
              in both diagrams and photos using a step-by-step system. All illustrations have a thorough explanation to help the reader understand better. Sailing is better understood and learned visually, making the illustrations shown in this guide
              worth it because itâ€™s as close as you can get of getting the real world experience without being on a boat. Sailing can be very risky but also extremely fulfilling and thrilling, attracting thousands of people to try sailing. If you would
              like to be one of the thousands of people that loves sailing and likes to know as much as you can about it, get your guide now.
